                    Patricio Romano Petronio Alvarez Quintero was a Colombian musician, poet and inspirer of music from
                    the Pacific, who was
                    born in Buenaventura on November 1, 1914. During his childhood, music became an important pillar in
                    his life, which led
                    him to dedicate himself to the guitar before the age of 20.
